1.2 Below Your Program
------------

The layers of software are organized primarily in a hierarchical fashion
1. Applications software 
2. Systems software
3. Hardware

Two types of systems sofware
1. operating system
	-  functions
		- Handling basic input and output operations
		- Allocating storage and memory
		-  Providing for protected sharing of the computer among multiple applications using it simultaneously. 
	- ex) Linux, MacOS, and Windows 
2. Compilers
	- The translation of a program written in a high­level language

<h3> From a High-Level Language to the Language of Hardware </h3> 
-  **Instructions** are just collections of bits that the computer understands and obeys, can be thought of as numbers
-  Using the computer to help program the com puter, the pioneers invented programs to translate from symbolic notation to binary. The first of these programs was named an **assembler**
- The name coined for this symbolic language, still used today, is **assembly language**. 
- Programmers today owe their productivity—and their sanity—to the creation of **high-level programming languages** and compilers that translate programs in such languages into instructions

1.3 Under the Covers
------------
- The underlying hardware in any computer performs the same basic functions: **inputting data, outputting data, processing data, and storing data**.

<h3> Through the Looking Glass </h3>
-  All laptop and almost all desktop computers now use **liquid crystal displays** (LCDs)

<h3> Opening the Box </h3>
- The **memory** is where the programs are kept when they are running
- **DRAM** stands for dynamic random access memory
	- Several DRAMs are used together to contain the instructions and data of a program
- The processor is the active part of the board
- Occasionally, people call the processor the CPU, for the more bureaucratic­sounding central processor unit.
