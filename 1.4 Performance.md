1.4 Performance
---------------

<h3> Defining Performance </h3>
- When we say one computer has better performance than another?
- we can define computer performance in several different ways
- faster one?
- Reducing response time - the time between the start and completion of a task - or execution time
- Increasing thoroughput or bandwidth -the total amount of work done in a given time

- execution time for a computer X:
	- Performance x = 1 / Execution time x

- X is n times faster than Y
	- Performance x / Performance y = n 
	- Execution time y / Execution time X = n

-  we usually say “improve performance” or “improve execution time” when we mean “increase performance” and “decrease execution time.”

<h3> Measuring Performance </h3>
- Time can be defined in different ways, depending on what we count.
-  The most straightforward definition of time is called *wall clock time, response time, or elapsed time*
- These terms mean the total time to complete a task, including disk accesses, memory accesses, input/output (I/O) activities, operating system overhead—every thing. 

- Computers are often shared
- The system may try to optimize throughput
- we wan to distinguish between the elapsed time and the time that the processor is working on behalf
	- **CPU execution time or CPU time** :  the time the CPU spends comput ing for this task and does not include time spent waiting for I/O or running other programs
	- CPU time can be devided: **user CPU time**, **system CPU time**
-  We will use the term  *system performance* to refer to elapsed time on an unloaded system and *CPU performance* to refer to user CPU time.
  
- Computer designers think about a computer by using a measure
- All computers are constructed using a clock that determines when events take place in 
- These discrete time intervals : **clock cycles (or ticks, clock ticks, clock per iods, clocks, cycles)**
-  Designers refer to the length of a **clock period** both as the time for a complete *clock cycle* (e.g., 250 picoseconds, or 250 ps) and as the clock rate (e.g., 4 gigahertz, or 4 GHz)

<h3> CPU Perfomrmance and Its Factors </h3>
- CPU execution time for a program =  CPU clock cycles for a program × Clock cycle time
- CPU execution time for a program = CPU clock cycles for a program / Clock rate

<h3> Instruction Performance </h3>
- CPU clock cycles = Instructions for a program  × Average clock cycles per instruction 
- **clock cycles per instruction(CPI)**: the average number of clock cycles each instruction takes to execute
